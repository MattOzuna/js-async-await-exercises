# JavaScript Async-Await Exercises

The purpose of these exercises was to practice using async/await.

## Part 1: Number Facts

1. Made a request to [The Numbers API](http://numbersapi.com/) for a random fact about my favorite number, then I appended it to index.html
<br/>

2. Made one request to the Numbers API for a random fact about 4 numbers between 1-100, then I appended them to index.html
<br/>

3. Made multiple requests to the API then using the Promise.all() method, then I appended them to index.html
<br/>

## Part 2: Deck of Cards

1. Made a request to the [Deck of Cards API](http://deckofcardsapi.com/) to request a single card from a newly shuffled deck. Console.loged the value and the suit (e.g. “5 of spades”, “queen of diamonds”)
<br/>

2. Made a request to the deck of cards API to request a single card from a newly shuffled deck. Once I had the card, made a request to the same API to get one more card from the same deck. Once I had both cards, I console.log the values and suits of both cards.
<br/>

3. I built an HTML page that lets you draw cards from a deck. When the page loads, go to the Deck of Cards API to create a new deck, and show a button on the page that will let you draw a card. Every time you click the button, display a new card, until there are no cards left in the deck.
